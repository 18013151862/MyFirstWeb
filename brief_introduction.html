With Barcelona he has won eight La Liga titles, four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA">UEFA</a> Champions League titles, and four Copas del Rey, among other trophies. Both a prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals scored in La Liga, a La Liga season (50), and a club football season in Europe (73), as well as those for most assists made in La Liga and the Copa America . He has scored over 500 senior career goals for club and country.</p>
